# What? #
As the tagline says - A Collection of WolfCMS Plugins.
What is WolfCMS go and check out http://www.wolfcms.org/

Wolf is a fork of FrogCMS http://www.madebyfrog.com/ so these
plugins may work with Frog (no guarantees though.)

And Frog is in turn a port of Radiant CMS for Ruby.

# The Plugins #
_Here is a list of the plugins I have currently developed:_

  * **BespinArea** - A take on the old EditArea.
> Bespin being the new Mozilla Canvas based code Editor.

> Go check it out if you haven't already https://mozillalabs.com/bespin/

  * **AssetJs / AssetCss**
> These are a set of plugins that provide the ability to manage javascript and stylesheets from with-in wolf.

> They take care of the build process for you.

> No longer do you have to manually compress and join together your code to get a nice performant website.

_And here are a list of plugins that I am thinking of or are in the middle of developing:_

  * **Themes**
> This will provide a way to bundle up a layout, snippets, js and css assets, images, other files that make up a complete theme for a website.

> Thus providing an easy way for Wolf developers to share themes.

  * **ShoppingCart**
> Yes even Wolf needs a Shopping Cart, at this stage I thinking of something simple like this: http://conceptlogic.com/jcart/

  * **Search**
> There are already a couple of different ways to implement a Local Site search with Wolf one on them being BlueWolfs simple yet effective method: http://www.wolfcms.org/forum/topic84.html as well as http://forum.madebyfrog.com/topic/354

> But I want to go one better, I want something that will do proper keyword based search and not return every single page that has the word "the" in it.
